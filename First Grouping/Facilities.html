                    The first floor features an open and functional layout with 5 computers each in the corners of the
                    room. The room has two wall fans which is on the left and right front side of the room offering a
                    well ventilated area for the customers.
                    <br><br>
                    This modern computers setup is designed for both gaming and productivity. At the center of the setup
                    is a 27-inch 2k ASUS Monitor, offering visual clarity and vibrant colors. The monitor is connected
                    to a high-end desktop PC with a liquid-cooled Intel Core i7 processor, 32GB of DDR4 RAM, and an
                    NVIDIA RTX 3080 graphics card, ensuring smooth performance for tasks ranging from graphic design to
                    gaming. The setup also includes a comfortable ergonomic chair with lumbar support, ensuring long
                    hours at the desk remain pleasant.

                    As for the second it is actually meant for the VIP customers. Just like in the first floor it also
                    has a 10 computers but the setup is different. As you can see, in the front corner 7 computers are
                    lined up and the other three are on the left and right side corner. The room is air conditioned
                    unlike in the first floor. Both floors follows a star like topology which is connected to a one
                    server only.
